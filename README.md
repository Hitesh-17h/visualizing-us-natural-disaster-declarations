# Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations: Trends and Patterns

## Problem Statement
Natural disasters significantly impact lives, infrastructure, and economies. The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize US natural disaster declaration data to identify trends, frequently affected regions, and commonly occurring disaster types. The insights derived can support better disaster preparedness and planning.
